        My name is Eshel Nagar. Fitness, chess, coding, and finances - these started as hobbies, but they&apos;re slowly becoming professions.  I haven&apos;t uploaded anything to LinkedIn yet, but I have uploaded a thing or two to GitHub. I do frequently post on Instagram. (You can find the links belowðŸ‘‡.)
