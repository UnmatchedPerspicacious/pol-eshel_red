        How I got to the project:
        <br />
        Basically because I already had the algo trading project I kept going for it just that now instead of thinking of it in a way which I first create the algorithm I thought of first creating a ml model which would also teach me a lot about it and would help my future algorithm learn.<br /> 
        <br />
        What I did:
        <br />
        I built a machine learning model and taught it to predict stocks open, high, low, volume, and close values and it actually got a very low loss function which is good because basically the lower it is the more accurate the model ðŸ—¿.
